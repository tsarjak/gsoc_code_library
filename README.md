# Hello, This is Sarjak Thakkar
## On this Repo, I'll host all the codes I will create for Processing Foundation as a student developer for Google Summer of Code 2017
As of now, this Repo contains a python code for Simulating Color Blindness using Daltonization Algorithm.

More Algorithms, research and codes will be uploaded as I proceed with my work in these three months
